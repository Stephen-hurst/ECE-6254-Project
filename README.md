Final version of codes for this project are mc_svr_pacman.py ; Pacman_Example_v4.py; mc_svr_fitted.py 
mc_svr_pacman.py uses the Monte Carlo algorithm to play Ms. Pac-Man. There is a difference in the scoring for this version and Pacman_Example_v4.py. This code was used to generate figures for the report.
Pacman_Example_v4.py uses NN to play Ms. Pac-Man
mc_svr_fitted.py is based off of the Pacman_Example_v4 code but uses the algorithms from mc_svr_pacman to fix the difference in scoring. Figures were not generated from this code.
